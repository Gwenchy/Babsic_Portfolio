                I am a Web Developer based in Florida who specialize in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, to mention a few. I am also a father of two very handsome boys 
                which are the reason why I always do my very best to impress so I can always provide for them. I have been tinkering with HTML and CSS for around 3 
                years but decided to take it a step further and learn more complicated languages and programs to upgrade my professionalism. So I went to a coding 
                bootcamp in UCF to learn more about web developing.

            <p>
                My goal is to integrate what I learned here into my previous knowledge so I can make more complex 
                web pages. My next step will be to continue studying towards computer engineering and make my little men be proud of their daddy
                (since right now they dont even know what I do:P).
